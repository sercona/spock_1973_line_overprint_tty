THE COMPLETE PICTURE IS CONSTRUCTED BY TAPING THE SHEETS TOGETHER SO THAT THE
LAST CHARACTER ON THE FIRST SHEET MEETS THE FIRST CHARACTER ON THE NEXT SHEET
WITH NO WHITE SPACE BETWEEN THEM.  THIS WILL REQUIRE TRIMMING THE SHEETS WITH
SCISSORS.  DO NOT PUT TAPE ON THE PRINTED SIDE OF THE PAPER; TAPE FROM BEHIND.
